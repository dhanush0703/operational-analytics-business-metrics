# Operational Analytics: Investigating and Improving Business Metrics

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive **SQL-based operational analytics case study** focused on investigating business performance, user engagement, and operational efficiency.  
The analysis simulates a real-world **product and operations analytics scenario**, where sudden metric changes and performance trends are diagnosed using structured data analysis.

All analysis, insights, SQL queries, and findings are documented in detail within the attached PDF report.

## What This Project Covers (Inside the PDF)

### 1. Operational Metrics Analysis
- Analysis of **jobs reviewed over time** to assess operational workload and productivity
- Calculation of **jobs reviewed per hour** to identify efficiency trends
- Identification of **low-activity periods** indicating potential operational slowdowns

### 2. Throughput & Performance Trends
- Calculation of **daily throughput (events per second)**
- Implementation of a **7-day rolling average** to smooth daily fluctuations
- Comparison of daily vs rolling metrics to evaluate long-term system performance

### 3. Data Quality & Reliability Checks
- Detection of **duplicate records** in operational datasets
- Identification of data redundancy on specific dates
- Highlighting potential **data integrity issues** impacting analytics accuracy

### 4. Language Share Distribution
- Analysis of **language-wise job distribution** across operational events
- Identification of dominant and underrepresented languages
- Insights into **regional or market skew** in operational workload

### 5. User Engagement Analysis
- Weekly user engagement tracking based on login activity
- Identification of **engagement spikes and drops**
- Correlation of engagement changes with external or operational factors

### 6. User Growth & Retention
- Month-over-month **user growth analysis**
- Weekly **retention analysis using cohort-based engagement**
- Identification of potential retention risks despite increasing signups

### 7. Device-Based Engagement Analysis
- Comparison of engagement across **mobile, tablet, and desktop**
- Identification of device preference shifts over time
- Detection of mobile engagement decline during specific periods

### 8. Email Engagement Metrics
- Analysis of email opens, clickthroughs, and re-engagement campaigns
- Weekly and monthly email performance evaluation
- Identification of declining clickthrough rates despite higher reach
